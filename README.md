## Cycle Detection
1. [Khan's Algorithm](khans_algo.cpp)[BFS for topological sort]: It only works for Directed Graph.
2. Union-Find Method: Uses the Union-Find data structure to detect cycles during the union operation. It only works for an Un-Directed Graph
3. DFS Method: Uses depth-first search to detect back edges. It works for both but in the Directed Graph it need the extra space to track that the the back edge is for the current path that is in the recursion stack. (see the [code](cycle_in_DG.cpp) for better understanding);

## Minimum Spanning Tree(MST)
1. [Prim's Algo](prims_algo.cpp)
    1. [Kingdom and its Roads](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/kingdom-and-its-roads/) 
2. [Cruskal's Algo](kruskals_algo.cpp)

## Strongly connected components(scc) -> Kosaraju Algo: follow three steps:
1. Sort the nodes on the basis of finishing time of dfs.
2. Reverese the edges
3. Run the dfs on nodes in their sorted finishing time.
4. [Code](kosaraju.cpp)

## Find-Bridge(Targan's Algo): 
- in this we keep track of the inTime of the node in which the dfs is called and the lowTime that stores the minimum time of the ancestors of it(or in-short the minimum inTime of the component this node is part of) so
1. when the nbr is not visited we call dfs on it and after finish assign the low[node] = min(low[node],low[nbr]) and check if the inTime[node] < lowtime[nbr] that this is a bridge
2. if not visited just use the back edge and assign the lowTime of node and nbr to the node: low[node] = min(low[node],low[nbr]);
[Targan's Algo](bridge.cpp)
